Project Title:
Data Mining and Analysis of Vocal Emotions for Predictive Modeling (Advanced)

Motivation:
The project was driven by the need to explore data mining techniques for emotion recognition in speech and song. Emotion recognition holds significant applications in human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and affective computing. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and feature extraction methods, the goal was to develop a reliable model capable of accurately identifying emotions in audio data.

1. Initial Model Evaluation
   - Utilized Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors for binary classification.
   - Evaluated model performance under various scenarios, including feature selection and outlier detection.

2. Preprocessing and Feature Selection
   - Applied min-max normalization and eliminated irrelevant features.
   - Utilized feature selection techniques to optimize K-NN classifier performance.

3. Feature Extraction and Model Training
   - Implemented the ROCKET algorithm for feature extraction.
   - Trained Logistic Regression models with varying parameters.

4. Motif and Anomaly Discovery
   - Employed the STOMP algorithm for motif and anomaly discovery in time series data.

5. Explainable AI
   - Trained a Decision Tree using predictions from a Neural Network.
   - Utilized the Lime tabular explainer for model interpretability.

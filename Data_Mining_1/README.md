Project Title:
Data Mining and Analysis of Vocal Emotions for Predictive Modeling (Basics - Intermediate)

Motivation:
The project aimed to explore data mining techniques, including pattern identification, clustering, and regression/classification analyses, to extract valuable insights from the dataset. This exploration contributes to the advancement of data science and business informatics.

1. Data Understanding
   - Provides an overview of the dataset and its variables.
   - Analyzes variable distribution and provides descriptive statistics.
   - Performs an initial dataset analysis to identify potential issues.

2. Data Quality
   - Discusses handling missing values and variable transformations.
   - Analyzes the correlation matrix and eliminates highly correlated variables.
   - Identifies and handles outliers in the dataset.

3. Data Clustering
   - Applies K-means, DBSCAN, and agglomerative hierarchical techniques for clustering.
   - Evaluates clustering algorithms and selects the best-performing one.

4. Classification
   - Applies K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes algorithms for classification.
   - Summarizes the results of classification algorithms.

5. Pattern Mining
   - Extracts frequent patterns and analyzes patterns with respect to MinSup parameter.
   - Extracts associative rules for different MinConf values.
   - Uses pattern mining techniques for vocal channel prediction (classification).

6. Regression
   - Summarizes the results of the regression analysis.
